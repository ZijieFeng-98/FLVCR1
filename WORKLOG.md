## 2025-10-23 (Project Setup)

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Created complete validation pipeline with 10 analysis scripts
- ‚úÖ Set up project structure with proper directories
- ‚úÖ Configured git repository and pushed to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive README with documentation
- ‚úÖ Added Makefile for automated execution

### Pipeline Components
- Environment setup script
- GEO data download automation
- scRNA-seq QC and cell type annotation
- Cross-dataset integration and pseudotime analysis
- Stage-specific expression profiling
- WGCNA co-expression network analysis
- GO/KEGG pathway enrichment
- Bulk validation with composition adjustment
- Cross-species ortholog mapping
- Quarto report generation

### Next Steps
- [ ] Run environment setup (`Rscript scripts/00_setup_env.R`)
- [ ] Download GEO datasets
- [ ] Process scRNA-seq data
- [ ] Generate validation results

### Notes
- Repository: https://github.com/ZijieFeng-98/FLVCR1
- Pipeline designed for human (GSE109037, GSE120508) and mouse (GSE107644) datasets
- Validation criteria: FLVCR2 >10√ó surge in spermatids

## Tips for Effective Logging

1. **Be Specific**: Include actual numbers, plot names, and file paths
2. **Record Errors**: Document error messages and solutions
3. **Track Time**: Helps with project planning
4. **Note Ideas**: Capture thoughts for future analysis
5. **Link Commits**: Reference git commits for reproducibility
